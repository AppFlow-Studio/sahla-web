-- Reconstructed from staging (rpepxdgdiqeirdqsazuc) migration history: ad_payments_and_admin_reporting
-- Business-ad payment history + admin reporting.
--
-- Until now, individual ad payments lived only in Stripe. The mosque admin
-- panel needs to show how long an ad has run, when its subscription started,
-- and when each invoice was paid — so the webhook now records every paid
-- invoice into ad_payments, and mosque admins get read access to the timing
-- data (ad_subscriptions.start_date) and the payment rows.
